# Frontend Mentor | Space tourism multi-page website

This is a solution to the Space tourism multi-page website. The challenge is from [Front-end Mentor.](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3)

## Developing
### What I learned

- This challenge was very good, I learned a lot of things, I decided that the application would consume a json, which I created `data.json` myself, to consume it I created a custom hook `useFetch.tsx`, to avoid the request every time it is processed the component, use the `useContext` hook, so I only have to make the request once, this is equated in the `fetchContext.tsx` file.
- In the process of developing the app I had some problems with TypeScript, anyway I spent hours thinking why I was getting this error, which by the way is about `fetchContext`, it may sound silly, but both FetchContext and FetchProvider should be written in UpperCamelCase, well, I wrote it in LowerCamelCase.
- I also failed too much creating the custom hook `useFetch.tsx`, more hours, deciphering because the first time I rendered the component, the data from `data.json` was not there, I solved this with useEffect, and useContext.
- After many problems, I began to study React a little more thoroughly, I learned to use mixins, from styled-components, since it repeated a lot of code, I studied a little bit of environment variables, and finally I reviewed a bit of React Router and I'm new in this but I started to get interested in react-transition-group.
